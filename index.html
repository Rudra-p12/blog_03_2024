            <p>OpenAI on Thursday launched ChatGPT search, positioning the company to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft’s Bing and Perplexity.In July, OpenAI announced it was beta-testing a prototype of the search engine,called SearchGPT, and now it’s officially rolled the product into ChatGPT.The feature offers up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, news, weather and more, powered by real-time web search and partnerships with news and data providers.
            The news comes after OpenAI closed its buzzy funding round earlier this month at a valuation of $157 billion, and also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit.</p>
